# Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot
# use additional data structures?

# Hints
#44 Try a hashtable
#117 Could a bit vector be useful?
#132 Can you solve it in O(N log N) time? What might a solution like that look like?

import numpy as np

    l = len(s)
